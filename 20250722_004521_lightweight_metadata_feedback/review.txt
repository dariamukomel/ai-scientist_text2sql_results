    "Summary": "The paper introduces a column-level execution feedback system for text-to-SQL that improves semantic correctness by detecting and correcting mismatches between query results and user intent. It combines domain-specific synonym matching with context-aware regeneration strategies, achieving 92.7% accuracy on easy+medium queries and 93.3% overall on a job vacancies benchmark.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Novel column-level execution feedback mechanism targeting semantic mismatches.",
        "Effective use of domain-specific synonym matching to address terminology mismatches.",
        "Context-aware regeneration strategies that activate only when relevant error patterns are detected.",
        "Demonstrated improvements in accuracy and robustness on a benchmark dataset."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Limited evaluation on a single benchmark, raising questions about generalizability.",
        "Lack of comparison with state-of-the-art methods, making it hard to assess relative performance.",
        "Unclear details on the regeneration strategy and synonym matching implementation.",
        "Potential biases or limitations in the domain-specific synonym matching are not addressed."

    "Questions": [
        "How does the proposed method compare to state-of-the-art text-to-SQL systems?",
        "Can the regeneration strategy be generalized to other domains beyond job vacancies?",
        "What are the computational overheads of the feedback mechanism?",
        "How robust is the synonym matching to variations in natural language phrasing?"
    ],
    "Limitations": [
        "The evaluation is limited to a single benchmark, which may not capture the full range of challenges in text-to-SQL.",
        "The method assumes static schemas and syntactically valid initial queries, which may not hold in real-world scenarios.",
        "The paper does not discuss the scalability of the approach to larger or more complex databases."
