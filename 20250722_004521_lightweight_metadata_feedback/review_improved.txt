{"Summary": "The paper introduces a column-level execution feedback system for text-to-SQL that aims to improve semantic correctness by detecting and correcting mismatches between returned columns and user intent. The system combines domain-specific synonym matching with context-aware regeneration strategies, achieving significant improvements in accuracy on a job vacancies benchmark.", "Strengths": ["Focuses on a critical challenge in text-to-SQL systems: semantic correctness.", "Introduces a novel column-level execution feedback mechanism.", "Provides a comprehensive evaluation with clear metrics and improvements over the baseline.", "Demonstrates robustness with minimal unparsed queries."], "Weaknesses": ["Limited evaluation domain (job vacancies) raises concerns about generalizability.", "Lacks detailed ablation studies to understand the contribution of each component.", "Comparisons with state-of-the-art methods could be more extensive."], "Originality": 4, "Quality": 3, "Clarity": 4, "Significance": 3, "Questions": ["How does the system perform on other domains or benchmarks like Spider?", "Can you provide more details on the computational overhead introduced by the feedback mechanism?", "What are the specific contributions of the synonym matching versus the context-aware regeneration?"], "Limitations": ["The evaluation is limited to a specific domain, which may not generalize to other domains.", "The paper does not fully explore the trade-offs between accuracy and computational overhead.", "The system does not handle schema evolution, which is a common real-world challenge."], "Ethical Concerns": false, "Soundness": 3, "Presentation": 4, "Contribution": 3, "Overall": 6, "Confidence": 4, "Decision": "Accept"}
