    "Summary": "The paper proposes M-schema, a structured representation for schema encoding, and a validated generation process to improve text-to-SQL conversion. The authors claim significant improvements in accuracy, particularly for JOIN and aggregation queries, through explicit schema validation and structured representations.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Novel structured schema representation (M-schema) that explicitly encodes table relationships and column properties.",
        "Validated generation process that enforces schema verification before SQL production.",
        "Demonstrated improvements in accuracy for JOIN and aggregation queries."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Lack of comparison with state-of-the-art methods, making it difficult to assess the true contribution.",
        "Unclear methodology details, particularly around the step-by-step validation process.",
        "Insufficient discussion on limitations and potential failure cases.",
        "Experimental setup is not fully transparent, and the dataset used (vacancies_normalized_duck) is not well-known or benchmarked.",
        "Results, while promising, are not convincingly superior to existing approaches."

        "What are the specific limitations of your approach, especially for hard queries?",
        "Why was the vacancies_normalized_duck dataset chosen, and how does it compare to standard benchmarks like Spider?"
    ],
    "Limitations": [
        "Limited comparison with state-of-the-art methods.",
        "Unclear generalizability due to the use of a non-standard dataset.",
