{"Summary": "The paper introduces M-schema, a structured representation for database schemas, and a step-by-step prompting method to improve text-to-SQL conversion. The approach aims to address common errors in JOIN conditions and aggregations by enforcing explicit schema validation before SQL generation. Experiments on the vacancies_normalized_duck dataset show improvements in accuracy, particularly for easy/medium queries.", "Strengths": ["Novel structured representation (M-schema) that explicitly encodes table relationships and column properties, showing 35% reduction in JOIN errors.", "Step-by-step prompting method that enforces schema validation, improving easy/medium query accuracy from 90.9% to 92.7%.", "Comprehensive evaluation with 22 configurations and detailed error analysis.", "Practical approach that maintains performance while supporting advanced SQL features."], "Weaknesses": ["Evaluation could be strengthened by including full standard benchmarks rather than subsets.", "Methodological details about M-schema implementation and validation process could be clearer.", "Performance on hard queries remains limited (only 25% accuracy)."], "Originality": 3, "Quality": 3, "Clarity": 3, "Significance": 3, "Questions": ["Can the authors provide more implementation details about M-schema's encoding format?", "How does the approach handle schemas with implicit relationships not captured by foreign keys?", "What modifications would be needed to apply this method to other text-to-SQL benchmarks?"], "Limitations": ["Performance drops 8.2% on schemas with implicit relationships or poor documentation.", "Error recovery fails for syntactically invalid initial queries.", "Limited success with nested subqueries and complex aggregations."], "Ethical Concerns": false, "Soundness": 3, "Presentation": 3, "Contribution": 3, "Overall": 6, "Confidence": 4, "Decision": "Accept"}
